## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that HTML footer takes some unintended space reducing the space occupied by html element.

To fix this the followig CSS snippet helped:

```css
html{
    height:100%;
}

body{
    min-height:100%;
}
```
### Continued development

- I have to improve the padding and scale.
- I have to learn more about flexbox, grid and positioning.
